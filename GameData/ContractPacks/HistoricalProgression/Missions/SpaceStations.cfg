	description = Salyut 1 (DOS-1) was the first space station of any kind, launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. More stations followed in the Salyut program, and heritage of that space station program is still in use on the ISS.\n\nSalyut 1 originated as a modification of the military Almaz space station program then in development. After the landing of Apollo 11 on the Moon in July 1969, the Soviets began shifting the primary emphasis of their manned space program to orbiting space stations. One other motivation for the space station program was a desire to one-up the US Skylab program then in development. \n\n Significance:\n Salyut 1 was the first designed Space Station and the Soyuz 11 crew set new duration records staying on the station for 22 days.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> April 19, 1971

Salyut 1 was moved to a higher orbit in July–August 1971 to ensure that it would not be destroyed prematurely through orbital decay. The end of the mission ended tragically when after departing Salyut 1, Soyuz 11 appeared to reenter normally, but it was found that all three of the crew had died. In honor of Alexi Leonov, Valeri Kubasov, and Pyotr Kolodin, we ask you to return this crew safely to @targetBody.

In the hours before re-entry, ground controllers adjusted Skylab's orientation to try to minimize the risk of re-entry on a populated area. They aimed the station at a spot 810 miles (1,300 km) south southeast of Cape Town, South Africa, and re-entry began at approximately 16:37 UTC, July 11, 1979. The station did not burn up as fast as NASA expected. Due to a 4% calculation error, debris landed southeast of Perth, Western Australia, and was found between Esperance and Rawlinna, from 31° to 34°S and 122° to 126°E, about 130–150 km radius around Balladonia. Residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful fireworks-like flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere.

The survey required photography with exposure times up to 8 min. Even small cosmonaut movements could shake the complex. This produced blurring of astronomical images, so all cosmonaut movements had to be stopped during the exposures.
